------ 

This project builds a simple client/server network for the University of Liverpool's Software Development in Practice module.
It includes an application to create a dictionary, serialisation it, and send to a server.


**How do I get started?**
------
1. Prerequisites:

   A functioning computer system (Windows/Mac/Linux).

   An installed version of Python 3.x.

2. Installation & Setup:

   Clone git repository: https://github.com/mr-mdd/CSCK541---EOM---Group-A.git

   Navigate to the Directory: ```cd CSCK541---EOM---Group-A```

   Ensure essential dependencies are installed via: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

3. Initiate the Program:

   Post setup, go to the root (CSCK541---EOM---Group-A) and run ```pip install -e .```

   Then run the server_wizard: ```python3 -m src.server.server_wizard```

   Then run the client_wizard: ```python3 -m src.client.client_wizard```


**Testing**
------
This project comprises a set of tools that serve as building blocks for communication between a client and a server. The primary entities under examination include the client, the server, utility tools like Branston and Crypt, and a suite of enums.
